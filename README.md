Printy is a simple and very, very basic ROBLOX "exploit" for general educational purposes only. Printy is not powerful whatsoever, it is a simple example exploit that 
prints a desired input to the ROBLOX developer console utilizing the Singleton offset.

This is currently outdated, there may need to be more changes to the program itself other than just the Singleton offset being updated. You can use IDA 7, another disassembler or use an already public offset data dump to grab your Singleton offset.
